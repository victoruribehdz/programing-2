## C
### Variables
 * int: Integer
 * float: Float
 * Char: Character
 * Char[]: String
 * void: Void
 * *ptr: pointer

### Processes
 * For: process that is realized if mets three sentences.
 * If: do the process if the condition is met.
 * While: do the process until the contidition stops to met it.
 * Else if: If the first condition is not met, try the second condition.
 * Else: do the process if any condition is met.
 * Struct: is the form to declare a structure that would be used in the principal code.
 * Printf: print the output
 * Scanf: scan the input

### Operators
 * &&: and
 * ||: or
 * <=: greater or equal than
 * >=: less or equal than
 * =: equal
 * <: greather or less than
 * ++: Increase
 * --: Decrease
 * !=: Desequal
 * ==: equal to 
 * -: substraction
 * +: addition
 * /: real division
 * *: multiplication
 * **: potence
 * %: residual
 * a = b ? c : d: Ternary operator
 * randoom: randoom function

### Pointers
 * malloc: asign a space memory for the variable.
 * calloc: clean and asing a space memory for the variable.
 * memset: free the space memory.
 * free: free the used space in memory by the variables.
 * realloc: reasign the space in memory by the variables.

### Files
 * Creation of a new file (fopen with attributes as “a” or “a+” or “w” or “w++”)
 * Opening an existing file (fopen)
 * Reading from file (fscanf or fgets)
 * Writing to a file (fprintf or fputs)
 * Moving to a specific location in a file (fseek, rewind)
 * Closing a file (fclose)

### Files modes
 * a: append
 * a+: append in the last line
 * w: write
 * w++: write in the last line
 * r: read

## Python
### Variables
 * 3: integer
 * 4.2: float
 * True: boolean
 * str: string
 * bool(): boolean
 * li = []: list
 * len: longitude
 * tup = []: tuple

### Operators
 * and: and
 * or: or
 * not: negation
 * <=: greater or equal than
 * >=: less or equal than
 * =: equal
 * <: greather or less than
 * ++: Increase
 * --: Decrease
 * !=: Desequal
 * ==: equal to 
 * -: substraction
 * +: addition
 * /: real division
 * //: exact division
 * *: multiplication
 * **: potence
 * %: residual
 * x = y if x < y else y: Ternary operator
 * for i in range: do the process for the variable in certain range

### Processes
 * For: process that is realized if mets three sentences.
 * If: do the process if the condition is met.
 * While: do the process until the contidition stops to met it.
 * Elif: If the first condition is not met, try the second condition.
 * Else: do the process if any condition is met.
 * Print: print the output
 * Scan: scan the input

### Files
 * open(): open the file
 * close(): close the file
 * write(): write in the file
 * read(): read the file

### Files modes
 * "a": for appending
 * "w": for writing
 * "r": for reading
 * "r+": for reading and writing
