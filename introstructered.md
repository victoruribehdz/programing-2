##What is a paradigma?:
We can speak of a paradigm as a set of beliefs, practices and knowledge that guide the development of a discipline over a period of time. In various branches of science, a set of ideas in force can be drastically replaced by another that conflicts with it and proves more accurate. Programming has its own paradigms, but the term "programming paradigm" does not necessarily represent a single model that must be respected until a better one appears. In fact, many paradigms currently coexist in harmony.

##Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features.
###Declarative: 
Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it. The programmer states only what the result should look like, not how to obtain it. No loops, no assignments, etc. Whatever engine that interprets this code is just supposed go get the desired information, and can use whatever approach it wants.
