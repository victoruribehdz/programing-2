-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is a paradigm?  

Programming paradigms are alternative approaches to programming processes. They fundamentally represent different approaches to building solutions to problems and therefore affect the entire software development process. 
According with [Hackages](https://blog.hackages.io/tech-terms-explained-programming-paradigms-8c4072404f8e):
> Programming is about solving problems and problems can usually be solved in a variety of ways. A programming paradigm is a way to approach a problem. While some programming languages allow you to use only one approach, most popular languages today allow developers to use a combination of them.
On the highest level, we can differentiate between 2 types of programming paradigms: imperative and declarative.

![Varieties of paradigms](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/1-344.png)

## Implementation methods of the programming paradigms.
According with Edukera, we must bear in mind that both [**interpreted** and **compiled**](https://www.edureka.co/community/6776/compiled-vs-interpreted-languages) programming are codes that translate all syntax into *machine language*. In this case, you have to define what machine language is. Machine language is those instructions that the computer processor understands and is a binary code (1 and 0)
The **compiled language** requires an additional step before its execution and converts the code to machine language, in addition a compiled language is much faster than one interpreted because when it is executed it is already in machine code. In short, it is a program that transforms the source code of a program to its equivalent in another lower-level programming language.

### Examples:
1. C
2. C ++
3. JAVA.
4. Go.

The **interpreted language** is a converter to machine language as it is executed. In short, it is a program that directly executes instructions written in a given programming language and is optimized for the moment of execution.

### Examples:
1. Python.
2. Ruby.
3. JavaScript.
In conclusion, compiling is done to optimize execution work and this means more work for the programmer. In the interpreted, it is made to be easier for the programmer and this means an extra effort for the execution.

## [Classification of programming paradigms.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-programming-paradigms/) 

### Imperative Programming paradigm. 
It performs step by step task by changing state. The main focus is on how to achieve the goal. The paradigm consist of several statements and after execution of all the result is stored. Here an [example](https://spines.me/es/help/markdown/syntax/) of code:
```
const container = document.getElementById(‘container’);
const btn = document.createElement(‘button’);
btn.className = ‘btn red’;
btn.onclick = function(event) {
 if (this.classList.contains(‘red’)) {
   this.classList.remove(‘red’);
   this.classList.add(‘blue’);
 } else {
   this.classList.remove(‘blue’);
   this.classList.add(‘red’);
 }
};
container.appendChild(btn);
```
1. **Procedural programming paradigm:**:
  This paradigm emphasizes on procedure in terms of underlying machine model. It has the ability to reuse the code and it was boon at that time when it was in use because of its reusability.  
BASIC, Pascal and C are examples of this paradigm.  
  
2. **Object Oriented Programming:**
  The program is written as a collection of classes and object which are meant for communication. More emphasis is on data rather procedure. It can handle almost all kind of real life problems which are today in scenario. This paradigm Examples: Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, Visual Basic, .NET, Ruby, Scala and PHP
  
3. **Parallel Processing approach:**
  Parallel processing is the processing of program instructions by dividing them among multiple processors. A parallel processing system posses many numbers of processor with the objective of running a program in less time by dividing them. This approach seems to be like divide and conquer.

4. ** Von Neumann:
> Anyone that contains a high degree of abstraction and is based on the von Neumann architecture is considered a programming language of the von Neumann type. .
Since programming languages like Fortran, C or Java were created in imitation of the von Neumann programming style, the differences between the three are barely noticeable. All programming is based on von Neumann's computer programming style.

> Some similarities of form between programming languages and von Neumann architecture are:
- Variables ↔ Storage cells
- Control instructions ↔ jump instructions
- Assignment instructions ↔ search, storage of instructions.
- Expressions ↔ Memory references and arithmetic instructions.

5. ** Interpreted (Scripting):
  [Interpreted](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/interpreted-script), sometimes is called script, is a logically sequenced series of operating system commands, handled one at a time by a command interpreter. It is a computer program capable of analyzing and executing other programs. Interpreters differ from compilers or assemblers in that while translators translate a program from its description in a programming language to the system machine code, the interpreters only perform the translation as needed, typically instruction by instruction. , and normally do not save the result of such translation.

### Declarative Programming paradigm.
Is a style of building programs that expresses logic of computation without talking about its control flow. The focus is on what needs to be done rather how it should be done basically emphasize on what code code is actually doing. It just declare the result we want rather how it has be produced. Here an [example](https://spines.me/es/help/markdown/syntax/) in a code:  
```
 class Button extends React.Component{
  this.state = { color: 'red' }
  handleChange = () => {
    const color = this.state.color === 'red' ? 'blue' : 'red';
    this.setState({ color });
  }
  render() {
    return (<div>
      <button 
         className=`btn ${this.state.color}`
         onClick={this.handleChange}>
      </button>
    </div>);
  }
}
```

1. **Logic Programming paradigm:**
  It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result.Examples: Mercury, ECLiPSe, QL, PROGOL, etc. 
  
2. **Functional Programming:**
  The functional programming paradigms has its roots in mathematics and it is language independent. The key principal of this paradigms is the execution of series of mathematical functions. The central model for the abstraction is the function which are meant for some specific computation and not the data structure. Examples:Python, Haskell, Lisp, Erlang y Clojure. 
  
3. **Databases Processing approach:**
  This programming methodology is based on data and its movement. Program statements are defined by data rather than hard-coding a series of steps. Examples: SQL.
  
4. **Structured**:
   Programming with clean, goto-free, nested control structures. Is a kind of imperative programming where control flow is defined by nested loops, conditionals, and subroutines, rather than via gotos. Variables are generally local to blocks.
 
 5. **Dataflow Programming paradigm**: 
   The control follows data and computations are executed implicitly based on data availability. Dataflow abstracts over explicit control flow by placing the emphasis on the routing and transformation of data.
 
 6. **Template-Based Programming paradigm**:
   Programming paradigm in which programs are constructed by using pre built templates. Code is generated by instantiating some kind of code template with some parameters (the domain-specific program).

7. **Structured Programming paradigm**:
   Programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection and repetition, block structures, and subroutines.


  
## [Programming language.](https://hackr.io/blog/what-is-programming-language)
A programming language is the translation from human language to machine language and is designed to carry out processes that only computers can achieve. They are used to create codes that control the behavior of the computer. These codes are expressed as algorithms as a mode of human communication. It is made up of symbols and syntactic rules that define its structure and the meaning of each expression and element. In addition there is a process which is testing, debugging, compilation and then the source code is maintained. That is called programming.
There are three types of programming language:
1. **Machine language (low level language)**:
 Collection of binary digits or bits that the computer reads and interprets (0 and 1)
2. **Assembly language (low level language)**:
  They are instructions, arithmetic operations such as ADD, SUB, DIV. Its advantages is that it has a higher encoding speed and its disadvantage is that it is not portable.
3. **High-level language**.
  Designed to make people write and understand the programs easier than the previous two. An example of them is C, Python, Java, etc.
 
## [Sequential algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/sequential-algorithm)
That in which one action follows another successively. A sequence is continued from the entry and exit of the actions until the process ends.
Example:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
int main (){
	float cate1, cate2, hipotenusa;
	
	printf("Ingrese los dos catetos de triangulo, por favor:\n");		scanf("%f %f",&cate1, &cate2);
	hipotenusa= sqrt(pow(cate1,2)+ pow(cate2,2));
	printf("La hipotenusa es igual a %.1f",hipotenusa);
	
	
	return 0;
}
```
## Source Code.  
Is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. Contains all the written instructions of a program to be later translated into machine language and executed.

## Spaghetti Code.
According with [Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/9476/spaghetti-code):
> Spaghetti code is a slang term used to refer to a tangled web of programming source code where control within a program jumps all over the place and is difficult to follow. Spaghetti code normally has a lot of GOTO statements and is common in old programs, which used such statements extensively.
The rise of more structured programming languages, like object-oriented programming languages, has reduced the prevalence of spaghetti code.

![spaghetti code](https://craftofcoding.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/pi_forspaghetti.jpg)

## Structured programm. 
[Structured programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structured-programming-approach-with-advantages-and-disadvantages/) can be defined with a focus on where the Program is executed with a unique structure in order to be Clear, precise and to optimize time. In other words, the code works instruction after instruction. It uses only subroutines and three structures: sequence, selection (if and switch) and iteration (for and while loops). It does not support the ability to jump from one statement to another with the help of a statement like GOTO.
[Structured programming](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/structured-programming-modular-programming) sometimes known as modular programmingis a programming paradigm that facilitates the creation of programs with readable code and reusable components. All modern programming languages support structured programming, but the mechanisms of support, like the syntax of the programming languages, varies.
### Examples:
1. C
2. C ++
3. Java
4. C #

## Data representations and operators.  

### Data Representation
- [**Identifier**]( http://aboutc.weebly.com/identifiers.html
): is a string of alphanumeric characters that begins with an alphabetic character or an underscore character that are used to represent various programming elements such as variables, functions, arrays, structures, unions and so on.
- [**Variables**](https://press.rebus.community/programmingfundamentals/chapter/constants-and-variables/
):  is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.
- **Constants**:  is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution.
- [**Reserved Words**](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/reseword.htm
): 
Reserved words are a term widely used in programming that consist of a group of identifiers that have a very important characteristic, they cannot be used by a user or programmer to name or refer to either variables, functions, objects, or any other programming item you want to create. This happens because the programming language itself contains them included and the objective is not to confuse and cause an error to the program.
Example:
do
else
for
if
return
void
while
However, it depends of the programming lenguage. 

- [**Types of data**]( https://dl.sumdu.edu.ua/textbooks/103395/597162/index.html
): is a type together with a collection of operations to manipulate the type.
  - Primitive: are predefined types of data, which are supported by the programming language. 
    - Boolean (e.g. True or False)
    - Character (e.g. abc)
    - Date (e.g. 03/01/2017)
    - Double (e.g. 1.87651234355743E308)
    - Floating-point number (e.g. 1.23)
    - Integer (e.g. 123)
    - Long (e.g. 123456789)
    - Short (e.g. 0)
    - String (e.g. abc)
    - Void (e.g. no data)
  - **Derivied**: is one whose values are composed of component values. One example is an array.
  - **User defined**: are mathematical models of a set of data values or information that share similar behavior or qualities and that can be specified and identified independent of specific implementations. An abstract data type is defined in term of its data items or its associated operations rather than by its implementation.

- [**Memory space for each data type**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_data_types.htm
):
  - Character: 1 byte
  - Unsigned character: 1 byte
  - Signed Character: 1 byte
  - Integer: 2 or 4 bytes
  - Unsigned Integer: 2 or 4 bytes
  - Short: 2 bytes
  - Unsigned Short: 2 bytes
  - Long: 8 bytes
  - Unsigned Long: 8 bytes
- [Range of values of each data type](https://xcbiology.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/table-e1438380260928.png):
  - Character: -128 to 127 or 0 to 255
  - Unsigned character: 0 to 255
  - Signed Character: -128 to 127
  - Integer: -32,768 to 32,767 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
  - Unsigned Integer: 0 to 65,535 or 0 to 4,294,967,295
  - Short: -32,768 to 32,767
  - Unsigned Short: 0 to 65,535
  - Long: -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
  - Unsigned Long: 0 to 18446744073709551615
- [**Data type conversion**](https://developerinsider.co/type-casting-c-programming/
): refers to either implicitly or explicitly changing a value from one data type storage format to another, e.g. a 16-bit integer to a 32-bit integer.  
Continued there is a graphic representation about data types from [Xin's story](https://datachenblog.com/2015/07/31/cc-data-type-and-memory-management/)

### Operators
- ***Conditional***: is an operator that returns one of two values depending on the result of an expression. It is represent with **“?:”**
- ***Logical***: Returns the result of a boolean operation.
  - Negation: It represents with **!**.
  - AND: It represents with **&&**.
  - Inclusive Or: It represents with **||**.
- ***Relationship***: are used to compare values of two variables.
  - Greater than >.
  - Greater than or equal to **>=**
  - Less than <
  - Less than or equal to **<=**
  - Equal to **==**
  - Not equal to **!=**

  ## Version control.  
  
[Version control](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/basics/what-is-version-control) is a piece of software that allows a person to manage the various changes made to a file. In other words, the version control tool is used to encode versions, binary and digital files.
Version control is sometimes called revision control and is a priority component in software configuration management. 

### How Does Version Control Work?
This tool allows many developers to work together on the same protector. This happens when the project becomes more complex and there is a need to handle multiple versions.

Version control is important for all code, files, and assets that multiple team members will collaborate on. Using version control software helps you keep track of changes and keep every team member working off the latest version. 
It needs to do more than just manage and track files. It should help you develop and ship products faster. 

That’s because using the right one:  
- Improves visibility. 
- Helps teams collaborate around the world. 
- Accelerates product delivery.  

![How does it work](https://miro.medium.com/max/1248/1*l08qyjBnX7K12p4DcINn3w.png)

#### Varieties: Distributed and centralized version control.
According with Michael Ernst, [there are two types of version control](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control.html), **centralized** and **distributed**. **Distributed** is  much faster to execute because it has more functions. All developers have their own copy of the repository, with all versions and all history. Of course, as they develop and make changes, their sources and versions are different from each other. However it is a little more complex and there is no main repository.  

![Distributed](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control-fig3.png)  

##### Examples:
1. Git.
2. Baazaar.
3. Mercurial.
4. Darcs.  

On the other hand, in the **centralized** all the sources and their versions are stored in a single directory, which is called the source repository, of a computer (server). For this reason, developers who want to work with those fonts should ask the version control system for a local copy to work with.  

![Centralized](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control-fig2.png)

##### Examples:
1. CVS.
2. Subversion.
